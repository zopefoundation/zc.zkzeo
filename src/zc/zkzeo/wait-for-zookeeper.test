If a storage server is configured with a static port and it can't talk
to ZooKeeper, it won't error, but will keep trying to talk to
zookeeper in a thread.

    >>> import ZEO.tests.forker
    >>> port = ZEO.tests.forker.get_port()

    >>> import zc.zkzeo.runzeo, zope.testing.loggingsupport
    >>> handler = zope.testing.loggingsupport.InstalledHandler('zc.zk')

    >>> stop = zc.zkzeo.runzeo.test('''
    ...   <zeo>
    ...      address 127.0.0.1:%s
    ...   </zeo>
    ...
    ...   <zookeeper>
    ...      connection 192.0.2.42:2181
    ...      path /databases/demo
    ...   </zookeeper>
    ...
    ...   <mappingstorage>
    ...   </mappingstorage>
    ... ''' % port)

We can connect to the server just fine:

    >>> client = ZEO.client(port)
    >>> client.is_connected()
    True

Let's wait a while:

    >>> import time
    >>> time.sleep(4)

We're asking for help:

    >>> print handler # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    zc.zk CRITICAL
      Can't connect to ZooKeeper at '192.0.2.42:2181'
    zc.zk CRITICAL
      Can't connect to ZooKeeper at '192.0.2.42:2181'
    ...

But data isn't in zookeeper yet:

    >>> import zc.zk
    >>> zk = zc.zk.ZooKeeper('zookeeper.example.com:2181')
    >>> zk.print_tree('/databases/demo')
    /demo

And the registration thread is still going:

    >>> import threading
    >>> [registration_thread] = [
    ...     t for t in threading.enumerate()
    ...     if t.name == 'zookeeper_registration_thread'
    ...     ]

Now, we'll "start" ZooKeeper:

    >>> ZooKeeper._allow_connection('192.0.2.42:2181')

    >>> registration_thread.join(1)

And we not have the entry in the tree:

    >>> zk.print_tree('/databases/demo')
    /demo
      /127.0.0.1:24491
        pid = 1013

And out client is still connected (of course):

    >>> client.is_connected()
    True

cleanup:

    >>> handler.uninstall()
    >>> client.close()
    >>> _ = stop()
